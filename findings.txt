Summarise your findings here (see specification).
Given that the approach to solving the sudoku puzzel is through brute
force, guessing each number possible. The difficulty of the puzzel can
be analysed through the number of iterations taken to find the
solution. For the easy problem it took 2,116 iterations while the
medium problem took 15,605 iterations. Problem for mystery1.dat took
546,167 iterations to find while the problem for myster3.dat took only
14,076 iterations. This should mean that the difficulty for mystery1
is higher tha that of mystery3.On the other hand it could have been
due to how numbers in the board were laid out which leads to more
iterations before a solution can be found.

Regarding mystery2.dat, it is the one that is impossible to solve, as
the program gaveup after 11,533. Meaning it couldn't find a solution
after trying all solutions. The program also stopped after only
reaching row 'H', which means it didn't reach the end and just didnt
report a success.

mystery1.dat = "extremely hard" difficulty
mystery2.dat = impossive to solve
mystery3.dat = "hard" difficulty
